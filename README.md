### Game Desscription
"In this adventure game, a player lands in Miami, Florida and decides he no longer wants to
live in the south, however things are not always what it seems. There are notable features
from each state that try to attack you and prevent you from leaving. As there are as many
monsters that attack you, there are just as many southern hospitality treatments and items that
may just convince you to stay. You will travel through each state looking for your missing
plane ticket which will allow you to leave."
